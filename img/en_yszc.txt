1. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information

The Application is designed and operated to control devices connected within a local area network. We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information, nor do we transmit or share user data over the internet. Specifically:

Local Area Network Device Information: The Application communicates with devices such as cameras, equatorial mounts, and guide cameras within the local area network. Information used includes the device's IP address and port number. This information is only used to establish device connections and control operations, with all data processing done locally. The Application does not store, upload, or communicate this information to external servers.

Camera Control and Photo Storage: The Application controls the camera via the LAN for imaging operations. Photos taken are stored directly on the device connected to the camera, such as a computer or storage device. We do not upload these photos to the cloud or any other server, nor do we perform remote backups.

Logs and Diagnostic Information: During the operation of the Application, we do not actively record or collect any user activity logs, error reports, or diagnostic information. The Application is designed for fully localized operation, ensuring no interference with user privacy.

2. How We Share, Transfer, or Disclose Your Personal Information

As the Application does not collect, store, or process any user data, there is no sharing or disclosure of information. We do not share any user data with third parties, nor do we sell or rent personal information in any form.

3. How We Protect Your Personal Information

Although the Application does not involve the storage or processing of personal data, we are committed to ensuring the security of your device's operating environment. To help protect your LAN, we recommend the following measures:

Use Strong Passwords: Ensure that your LAN and device connections are secured with strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access.

Enable Encryption: When possible, enable encryption protocols (e.g., WPA2) to protect your network communications and prevent data interception.

Regular Firmware Updates: Ensure that the firmware and control software for devices like cameras, equatorial mounts, and guide cameras are kept up to date to minimize potential security risks.

4. How We Handle Children’s Personal Information

We take the privacy of children seriously. As the Application does not involve the collection or processing of personal data, it is suitable for users of all ages, including children. Parents or guardians can safely allow children to use the Application without concern for privacy issues.

5. Third-Party Services

The Application relies on hardware devices within the local area network, which may require integration with third-party open-source projects or hardware drivers. These third-party projects are managed by their respective developers or companies, and the Application is not responsible for their privacy policies or data handling practices. Therefore, we recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand how they process your data and protect your privacy.

6. How This Policy is Updated

To address changes in laws and regulations or to improve privacy protection measures, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When significant changes are made, we will post a notification within the Application. We recommend checking this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed of our current data protection practices. Each update to the Privacy Policy will include an effective date.
